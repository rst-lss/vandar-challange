# vandar-challange
This project is an interview challenge for a front-end position in Vandar. It means that this is only for showing my skills and has no other purpose. I hope you enjoy it!

`Please Note`: there are places in this project that you will tell yourself it should be more or it would be more accurate to do so. For example: short description for pull reqeusts or wrong semantic version. I'm aware of that! and I'm truly sorry for that but I did this intentionally to save time. It is not because my laziness. Thanks :)
